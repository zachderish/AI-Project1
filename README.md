# Intro to AI CS440 - Project1

“graphGen.py” will generate text files of the expected format for the A* to run on
If you already have text files to work with, skip this step
1. Input the number of columns
2. Input the number of rows
3. Input the number of graph files you want to create


RUN “python graphics.py" # This program visualizes and executes A* on a grid defined by the text file input, a Popup will appear

1. insert the name of the graph you wish to test in the box labeled “file path”
2. Select whether you want to run the A* Algorithm or the Theta* Algorithm
3. You are also able to input the x and y coordinates of a node to retrieve its values

# red line indicates the route the algorithm took to reach its destination
# The gray blocks are the “blocked” boxes
